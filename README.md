# KazLLM-70B-GGUF4-Running-Large-Language-Models-in-Google-Colab
This guide demonstrates how to run the **KazLLM-70B-GGUF4** model in Google Colab using `llama-cpp-python`. The model is optimized for 4-bit quantization and runs efficiently on systems with large GPU memory (40GB+)
The guide covers:
- Setting up Google Colab for running KazLLM-70B.
- Loading and initializing the GGUF format model.
- Optimizing performance using GPU layers.
- Generating text using the model.
  
## Requirements

- A Google Colab account with GPU enabled.
- At least 40GB of GPU memory (supports high-end GPUs like A100).
- Basic understanding of Python and Google Colab.

## How to Use

1. Open the Google Colab notebook.
2. Copy the code provided in this repository.
3. Follow the steps to install libraries, download the model, and run it.

## Key Features of This Guide

- Uses `llama-cpp-python` for high performance on GGUF models.
- Optimized for the Kazakh language with KazLLM.
- Supports 4-bit quantization for efficient memory usage.
- Easy-to-follow steps for anyone familiar with Python.
