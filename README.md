# KazLLM-70B-GGUF4-Running-Large-Language-Models-in-Google-Colab
This guide demonstrates how to run the **KazLLM-70B-GGUF4** model in Google Colab using `llama-cpp-python`. The model is optimized for 4-bit quantization and runs efficiently on systems with large GPU memory (40GB+)
The guide covers:
- Setting up Google Colab for running KazLLM-70B.
- Loading and initializing the GGUF format model.
- Optimizing performance using GPU layers.
- Generating text using the model.
